# Mobile Application 

## Tilt Maze



*Author: Mike Falk*

## Description
This is a C# Xamarin mobile application that will emulate the old tilt mazes that we used to get as party favors when we were kids on a mobile device. The user will hold their device flat and the app will access the accelerometer to determine pitch and simulate rolling a ball(ellipse) through a maze to a target on the other side of the screen. An additional surprise will occur when the user gets the ellipse in the target. The phone will take a selfie shot and save it to their photo album.
